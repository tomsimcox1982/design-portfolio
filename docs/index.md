I'm Tom and I've worked in user experience design and web development for over 20 years. I'm passionate about solving problems for users and businesses through well-thought-out technology and content.

I've worked as an employee and a contractor with central government departments, industry regulators and private companies. Right now I'm helping Defra and UK waste regulators transform how waste movements are recorded and reported on.

You can find a [list of the organisations and agencies I've worked with](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-simcox-content-designer/) and request to connect with me on LinkedIn. You can also [download my curriculum vitae (PDF)](downloads/tom-simcox-cv-2025.pdf).

Away from my day job I love to travel, hike, swim and enjoy nature.
